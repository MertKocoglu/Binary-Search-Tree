# Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation in Java

This project implements a basic Binary Search Tree (BST) in Java. A BST is a data structure that maintains a sorted order of elements and allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations. This implementation supports constructing a BST, inserting elements, performing inorder traversal, finding a node's parent, and deleting elements from the tree.

## Features

- **CONSTRUCT**: Builds a BST from a given array of values.
- **INSERT**: Inserts a new value into the BST and prints the parent of the inserted node.
- **LIST**: Performs an inorder traversal of the BST and prints the values in ascending order.
- **PARENT**: Finds and prints the parent of a given value.
- **DELETE**: Removes a value from the BST, maintaining the BST properties.
